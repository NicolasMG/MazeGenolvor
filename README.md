# MazeGenolvor
Welcome in my personal project allowing the generation and resolution of mazes in C# 

Current State :
Generation of Maze with option Enter-Exit
Resolution of Maze generated from point top-left to point bottom-right with A* algorithm

Next versions will add:
  - various existing algorithms for the generation and the resolution (Eller’s algorithm, Prim’s algorithm, recursive division algorithm, ...)
  - Fixe start and end Point.

Sidenote :
The current display unables the visualisation of Maze of a certain size.
2 pictures are generated in the executed file folder. The Maze and it's resolution


Thanks to Jamis Buck for the maze generation
