# MazeGenolvor
Welcome in my personal project allowing the generation and resolution of maze in C# 

Current State :
Generation of Maze with option Enter-Exit
Resolution of Maze generated from point top-left to point bottom-right with A* algorithm

Next versions will add various existing algorithms for the generation and the resolution (Eller’s algorithm, Prim’s algorithm, recursive division algorithm, ...)
